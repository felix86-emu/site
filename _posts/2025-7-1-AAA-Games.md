Another month has passed, and felix86 development continues!

# AAA games

Some AAA games are now playable! Titles include Linux games like Witcher 2, but also Windows games like Witcher 3 and Crysis!

These just started working, so we haven't had enough time to profile or optimize them yet. So donâ€™t expect great performance yet!

## User-friendliness

The recommended way of using felix86 now is through the emulated bash.

To do so, install felix86 using the installation script (or register it with binfmt_misc using `sudo -E felix86 -b`), then run the x86-64 version of bash:
```
FELIX86_QUIET=1 felix86 /bin/bash
```

This should start an instance of the emulated bash that is now inside the rootfs. You can use it to run your games.

To learn more, [check out the updated usage guide](https://github.com/OFFTKP/felix86/blob/master/docs/how-to-use.md).


## AppImage support

AppImages had a permission issue - basically they would try to run a privileged app like `mount`, but when this was run through the emulator, the emulator would not inherit the privileges.

Since we now install felix86 in binfmt_misc, the emulator should inherit the setuid bit of these apps, and AppImage executables should now work!

## Better filesystem emulation

We try to restrict all guest file accesses inside the rootfs. In recent PRs we improved a few things.

`/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run` and `/tmp` were symlinks. The reason for this is that mounting requires superuser privileges. Using namespaces doesn't cut it, because then we wouldn't be able to run apps like `sudo` or `mount`. Additionally, using namespaces to get mount privileges means that other instances of felix86 won't see the same mounts as that instance.

But symlinks have their own set of problems.  For example, `readlink(/proc)` would be equal to `/proc`, causing recursion in the guest. This was previously solved by detecting accesses to `/proc` (and the others) and redirecting them to the host `/proc`. All in all, it was hacky and horrible.

We now use a separate executable, called `felix86-mounter`. The installation script will install it and give it special privileges. Then, felix86 will call `felix86-mounter` with the rootfs path as the argument. `felix86-mounter` will then do a few things:
- Create a temporary dir called `/run/felix86/mounts/mount-XXXXXX` (where the X's are random using `mkdtemp`)
- Create a file that has the actual rootfs path in `/run/felix86/mounts/mount-XXXXXX/path.txt`
- Create a directory `/run/felix86/mounts/mount-XXXXXX/rootfs`
- Mount the rootfs there (this is good because now the rootfs itself is a mount, just like `/` is)
- Mount the necessary dirs (`/dev`, `/proc`, ...) inside the rootfs
- Return the `/run/felix86/mounts/mount-XXXXXX/rootfs` path

Further runs of `felix86-mounter` will detect that a mounted path already exists using the `path.txt` file.

This is better than doing it on the felix86 executable:
- If we did this inside the felix86 executable itself, it would need special permissions which is definitely scarier if we don't properly drop them after mounting
- The felix86 executable frequently changes and needs to be given permissions again, felix86-mounter will not
- Having to run sudo everytime you want to run felix86 would be clunky
- Having to run sudo on anything you attach to felix86 (gdb, strace, ...) would also suck

## Symlink resolving

We had a bug in our previous implementation, which happened to go undetected:

The symlink syscall would resolve the old path to be inside the rootfs. For example, if you ran `symlink(/oldpath, /linktarget)`, `/linktarget` would now resolve to `/path/to/rootfs/oldpath`.

This would work with *most applications*. However, as we start to worry about programs calling `chroot` and changing our root, this is no longer a viable solution.

Symlink shouldn't resolve the old path to be inside the rootfs. But if we don't do that, then we need to resolve paths ourselves using the [same algorithm the kernel uses](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/path_resolution.7.html), while placing results in the rootfs. This is difficult to implement while avoiding potential bugs.

Luckily, the `openat2` syscall has a flag called `RESOLVE_IN_ROOT`. This is perfect for our use case, as it can open a file while resolving symlinks to be inside a file descriptor -- our rootfs file descriptor. We can then readlink the `/proc/self/fd/<fd>` to get the absolute resolved path that is inside the rootfs.

This also helps with containerization, as it makes it harder for programs to escape the rootfs. felix86 isn't a security application and should only be used with trusted programs, but some programs would do stuff like `fd = open("/")`, `openat(fd, "..")` and depend on the file descriptors being the same, which we previously had to hack around.

Thanks for reading the July post!

It was an exciting month for felix86 progress. See you in a month!
